        "advisory": "### Impact\n\nSince Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)",

This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.\n\n",

The vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).\n\n### Reproducer\n\n```python\nfrom aiohttp import web\n\nasync def example(request: web.Request):\n    headers = dict(request.headers)\n    body = await request.content.read()\n    return web.Response(text=f\"headers: {headers} body: {body}\")\n\napp = web.Application()\napp.add_routes([web.post('/', example)])\nweb.run_app(app)\n```\n\nSending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n```console\n$ printf \"POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8080\\r\\nX-Abc: \\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nA\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\\n  | nc localhost 8080\n\nExpected output:\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '\\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked'} body: b''\n\nActual output (note that 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is an HTTP header now and body is treated differently)\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'} body: b'A'\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of aiohttp to resolve this vulnerability. It has been fixed in v3.8.5: [`pip install aiohttp >= 3.8.5`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.8.5/)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you aren't able to upgrade you can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable to request smuggling:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip uninstall --yes aiohttp\n$ AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 python -m pip install --no-binary=aiohttp --no-cache aiohttp\n```\n\n### References\n\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30589\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873\n",

Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.\n\ni.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:\n```\napp.router.add_routes([\n    web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability\n])\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.\n\n### Workaround\nEven if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.\n\nIf using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.\n\nAdditionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files",

        "advisory": "# Summary\nThe HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling.\nThis parser is only used when `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel).\n \n# Details\n\n## Bug 1: Bad parsing of `Content-Length` values\n\n### Description\nRFC 9110 says this:\n> `Content-Length = 1*DIGIT`\n\nAIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, presumably because of an incorrect usage of the builtin `int` constructor. Because the `int` constructor accepts `+` and `-` prefixes, and digit-separating underscores, using `int` to parse CL values leads AIOHTTP to significant misinterpretation.\n\n### Examples\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length: -0\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length: +0_1\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n\n### Suggested action\nVerify that a `Content-Length` value consists only of ASCII digits before parsing, as the standard requires.\n\n## Bug 2: Improper handling of NUL, CR, and LF in header values\n\n### Description\nRFC 9110 says this:\n> Field values containing CR, LF, or NUL characters are invalid and dangerous, due to the varying ways that implementations might parse and interpret those characters; a recipient of CR, LF, or NUL within a field value MUST either reject the message or replace each of those characters with SP before further processing or forwarding of that message.\n\nAIOHTTP's HTTP parser does not enforce this rule, and will happily process header values containing these three forbidden characters without replacing them with SP.\n### Examples\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\x00alue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\ralue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\nalue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n### Suggested action\nReject all messages with NUL, CR, or LF in a header value. The translation to space thing, while technically allowed, does not seem like a good idea to me.\n\n## Bug 3: Improper stripping of whitespace before colon in HTTP headers\n\n### Description\nRFC 9112 says this:\n> No whitespace is allowed between the field name and colon. In the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling. A server MUST reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon.\n\nAIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, and will simply strip any whitespace before the colon in an HTTP header.\n\n### Example\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length : 1\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n\n### Suggested action\nReject all messages with whitespace before a colon in a header field, as the standard requires.\n\n# PoC\nExample requests are embedded in the previous section. To reproduce these bugs, start an AIOHTTP server without llhttp (i.e. `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1`) and send the requests given in the previous section. (e.g. by `printf`ing into `nc`)\n\n# Impact\nEach of these bugs can be used for request smuggling.",

It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root.

The vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).\n\n### Reproducer\n\n```python\nfrom aiohttp import web\n\nasync def example(request: web.Request):\n    headers = dict(request.headers)\n    body = await request.content.read()\n    return web.Response(text=f\"headers: {headers} body: {body}\")\n\napp = web.Application()\napp.add_routes([web.post('/', example)])\nweb.run_app(app)\n```\n\nSending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n```console\n$ printf \"POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8080\\r\\nX-Abc: \\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nA\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\\n  | nc localhost 8080\n\nExpected output:\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '\\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked'} body: b''\n\nActual output (note that 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is an HTTP header now and body is treated differently)\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'} body: b'A'\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of aiohttp to resolve this vulnerability. It has been fixed in v3.8.5: [`pip install aiohttp >= 3.8.5`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.8.5/)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you aren't able to upgrade you can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable to request smuggling:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip uninstall --yes aiohttp\n$ AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 python -m pip install --no-binary=aiohttp --no-cache aiohttp\n```\n\n### References\n\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30589\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873\n",

        "advisory": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this vulnerability.",
